      "content": "4(1) No real estate may be leased for residential purposes, or for any commercial or industrial purpose, or for use as an office for practicing any profession or freelance work except by virtue of a Lease Contract drawn up on the form approved by the Municipality. The Lessor must attest the Lease Contract at the Municipality and pay the prescribed attestation fees, or ensure that the Lessee attests and pays the same, within a maximum period of twenty-one (21) days after the signing of the concerned Lease Contract by the Lessor and the Lessee. In the event of failure to attest the Lease Contract, the Lessor shall be punished with a fine equal to three times the prescribed attestation fees for the concerned Lease Contract. Every renewal of the Lease Contract term shall be treated as a new Lease Contract that must be attested and the prescribed fees paid thereon in the same manner stipulated above.\n\n4(2) The Lease Contract, attested by the Municipality in the manner referred to in Clause (4(1)) above, shall have the force of an official instrument regarding the contents of that contract, and shall be legally accepted for compulsory execution in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Procedure Law applicable in the State.\n\n4(3) The special conditions recorded in the Lease Contract concluded between the Lessor and the Lessee shall be read and interpreted as an integral part of the Lease Contract and binding on both parties unless the Disputes Committee decides, upon the request of any party, that those special conditions, or any of them, are unfair and contrary to the provisions of this Decree or the prevailing customs in real estate leasing in the Emirate.\n\n4(4) Government departments and institutions in the Emirate, both local and federal, may not accept any real estate Lease Contract in the Emirate of Ajman in any transaction whatsoever unless that contract is attested by the Municipality in the manner described in Clauses (4(1)) or (4(2)) above.

      "title": "Lease Term",
      "content": "5(1) The lease term must be specified and agreed upon between the parties. If such term is not explicitly specified in the Lease Contract, the Lease Contract shall be deemed concluded for one year.\n\n5(2) If the Lease Contract includes a specific term, the Lease Contract may not be terminated during its valid term mentioned therein except by mutual consent, or in accordance with the provisions of Article (5(5)) or the provisions of Article (12) of this Decree, as the case may be. If the contract term expires and the Lessee remains utilizing the Leased Property without a written demand from the Lessor to the Lessee to vacate the property in accordance with the provisions of Article (12) of this Decree, and provided the Lessee pays the Rent Amount at the time prescribed for payment, then the Lease Contract shall be implicitly and automatically renewed with the same conditions applicable at that time for an additional year, even if a new Lease Contract is not signed between the Lessor and the Lessee. Such renewal of the contract term is without prejudice to the right of the Municipality to collect the prescribed annual fees from the Lessor for attesting the renewed Lease Contract.\n\n5(3) Subject to the provisions of Articles (9(5)) and (9(6)) of this Decree, the term of a Sublease contract issued by the original Lessee to a Sub-lessee shall expire upon the expiry of the term of the original Lease Contract unless the original Lessor agrees in writing to extend the term of the Sublease contract.\n\n5(4) The Lessee shall not be prejudiced by the transfer of ownership of the Leased Property to a new owner, or by the death of the Lessor if he is a natural person, or by his dissolution and liquidation if he is a legal person. The new Lessor may not demand the eviction of the Lessee from the Leased Property or increase his Rent Amount except only in accordance with the provisions of this Decree. However, the heirs of the Lessee may terminate the tenancy relationship on the date agreed upon for the end of the contract term, or within a maximum period of sixty days from the date of the death of their testator, whichever is earlier. In this case, the new Lessor is entitled to collect the Rent Amount from the Lessee until the date on which the actual eviction takes place.\n\n5(5) If the Lease Contract contains a specific term, the Lessee may not terminate the contract before the expiry of its term unless he gives the Lessor notice of his desire to terminate the contract two months prior to the date intended for his vacating of the Leased Property and agrees to pay an amount to the Lessor equivalent to two months' rent. In the event of failure to give such notice, the Lessee shall remain legally obligated to pay, and may be claimed at any subsequent time to pay, the Rent Amount to the Lessor until the date the Lessor receives the concerned Leased Property, even if it is proven that it was actually vacated by the Lessee before the date of the Lessor's receipt thereof.\n\n5(6) The Lessee shall not be exempted from paying the Rent Amount in the event a lawsuit is filed by any party against the other party, throughout the duration of hearing the lawsuit and the issuance of the judgment therein and its execution, as long as the Lessee remains occupying the concerned property."

    "Article_6": {
      "title": "Rent Amount",
      "content": "6(1) The parties to the Lease Contract must specify the amount of the Rent Amount within the conditions of the Lease Contract. The Rent Amount becomes due on the Lessee upon his utilization of the benefit of the Leased Property or upon his ability to utilize it, including the right to use the facilities of the Leased Property such as swimming pools, gyms, health clubs, and car parks, unless the contract explicitly stipulates otherwise.\n\n6(2) The parties to the Lease Contract may agree to accelerate the payment of the Rent Amount, or defer it, or pay it in installments payable at specific times explicitly determined in the Lease Contract. If there is no agreement regarding such installments, or if it is impossible to prove their due dates to the Lessor, then the Rent Amount must be paid in four installments of equal value.\n\n6(3) If the parties neglect to specify the amount of the Rent Amount in the Lease Contract, and it is impossible to prove the amount of the Rent Amount by customary legal evidence, then the Lessor shall be entitled to the \"Rent of Similar\" (Market Rent) determined by the Disputes Committee for the Leased Property. When determining the \"Rent of Similar,\" the Disputes Committee shall take into consideration the conditions of the leased real estate market in the Emirate, including construction and maintenance costs at the time of the dispute, or the average amount of rent for three properties in the area of the concerned Leased Property that are approximately similar in condition and age to the Leased Property subject of the dispute, in addition to any other standards, circumstances, or factors as the Disputes Committee may deem appropriate to consider for the purpose of reaching a sound and reasonable decision regarding the determination of the \"Rent of Similar\" subject of the dispute.\n\n6(4) If the contract term is extended implicitly and automatically by operation of law in accordance with the provisions of Article (5(2)) of this Decree, the Lessor shall be entitled to the Rent Amount that was applicable immediately prior to the extension term, and it shall continue to apply for one year from the date of expiry of the original Lease Contract term, unless the Disputes Committee decides on a longer period as it may deem appropriate.\n\n6(5) If the Lessee discovers, after signing the Lease Contract, that the Rent Amount mentioned in the Lease Contract exceeds, exorbitantly, the rent amounts mentioned in lease contracts for properties similar to his Leased Property located in the same building or in the area of the Leased Property, and that the said lease contracts were concluded during the last three (3) months immediately preceding the date of his contract, then the Lessee may file a complaint with the Disputes Committee requesting a reduction of the Rent Amount mentioned in the Lease Contract to be equal to the \"Rent of Similar\" for similar properties in the same building or in the area of the Leased Property subject of the dispute. In this case, the Disputes Committee may, by a decision it issues—provided it is based on reasonable justifications—determine the \"Rent of Similar\" and oblige the Lessor to it, and exempt the Lessee from paying any increase in the Rent Amount imposed on him by the Lessor in the Lease Contract without legitimate justification.\n\n6(6) Subject to the provisions of Article (6(7)) below, the Lessor may not increase the amount of the Rent Amount mentioned in the Lease Contract signed by him except after the lapse of three (3) full years from the commencement date of the Lease Contract, or from the date of the last increase imposed by the Lessor on the Rent Amount mentioned in the Lease Contract, whichever date is later. The Lessee who commits to paying the new Rent Amount on its due dates has the right to continue occupying the Leased Property and utilizing the benefit thereof, under the same conditions of the Lease Contract signed by the parties, throughout the said three (3) years, whether a new Lease Contract is signed or not.\n\n6(7) The Lessor may increase the Rent Amount mentioned in the Lease Contract after the expiry of the three years mentioned in Article (6(6)) above, subject to two conditions:\n(1) That he sends a written notice delivered to the Lessee at least two months before the expiry date of the current Lease Contract; and\n(2) That the increase does not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the Rent Amount applicable at the time of the said notice. If the two mentioned conditions are met, the Lessee may not object to such increase.\n\n6(8) Notwithstanding the provision of Article (6(6)), the Lessor may request the Disputes Committee to increase the Rent Amount by a percentage higher than twenty percent (20%) of the applicable Rent Amount at the concerned time. However, for the Lessor's request for the increase to be granted, it is required:\n(a) That a full year has elapsed from the effective date of the concerned Lease Contract, or from the date of the last increase in the Rent Amount, as the case may be; and\n(b) That the Lessor has actually performed improvements or maintenance works of high cost in the Leased Property before the date of his request to increase the rent, or otherwise, that the Lessor's request for the required increase is based on legally acceptable evidence confirming the occurrence of significant increases in real estate prices in the Emirate or in construction and maintenance costs, or that the request is based on any other economic justifications that satisfy the Disputes Committee; and\n(c) That the Lessor has notified the Lessee in writing of the increase three (3) months before the expiry date of the lease term applicable at that time, and the Lessee remained in possession of the Leased Property without a written objection from him to the required increase delivered to the Lessor within seven (7) days from the date of his receipt of the Lessor's notice of increase. Such objection shall not be considered unless the Lessee delivers a copy thereof, within the said seven (7) days, to the Rapporteur of the Disputes Committee. In the event the Lessee objects to the increase, he must file a lawsuit with the Disputes Committee to determine the amount of increase in the Rent Amount applicable at that time. The Disputes Committee shall decide on the lawsuit after taking into consideration the circumstances, factors, and standards mentioned in Article 6(3) above.\n\n6(9) If the Lessor increases the Rent Amount by a percentage higher than 20% without fulfilling the requirements of Article 6(6) and Article (6(7)), or if he does not comply with the decision of the Disputes Committee to correct this violation, the Disputes Committee may impose on the violating Lessor a fine of not less than five thousand (5,000) Dirhams and not exceeding twenty thousand (20,000) Dirhams."

      "content": "7(1) Once the Rent Amount, or the accelerated part thereof, is paid, the Lessee has the right to utilize the Leased Property fully and without hindrance impeding its utilization. The Lessee has, in particular, the right to possess the Leased Property in quiet and continuous possession until the lease term agreed upon in the Lease Contract expires.\n\n7(2) The Lessor must maintain the property as stated in Article (8) of this Decree, unless the parties have explicitly agreed otherwise in the Lease Contract.\n\n7(3) The Lessor may not cause any damage or change to the Leased Property that prevents the Lessee from fully utilizing the Leased Property in the required manner in accordance with the provisions of this Decree.\n\n7(4) The Lessor may not, whether personally or through others, cut off electricity, water, telephone, or any other similar services from the Leased Property, or remove, destroy, or disable any of the features or benefits that were available in the Leased Property at the time of its lease, or perform any other act intended to deprive the Lessee of the full enjoyment of the benefits of the Leased Property, or intended to force the Lessee to vacate the property or accept any increase in the Rent Amount contrary to the provisions of this Decree and the provisions of the Lease Contract. In the event of any act by the Lessor in violation of the foregoing, the Lessee has the right to submit an urgent request to the Chairman of the Disputes Committee for redress. In this case, the Chairman of the Disputes Committee must, on behalf of the Disputes Committee and in the shortest possible time, issue his order in writing to the Lessor or to any concerned official entity in the Emirate, including the Police, the Municipality, and the Electricity, Water, and Telecommunications Authority, to remove the violation or to compel the Lessor to remove it within a specific period determined by the Chairman of the Disputes Committee in his decision, as the case may be, as a temporary measure until the Disputes Committee decides on the request definitively. The government entities and other concerned authorities must execute the order issued by the Chairman of the Disputes Committee as soon as possible. In the event the violation is not removed within the period specified in the order of the Chairman of the Disputes Committee for any reason whatsoever, the Chairman of the Disputes Committee may allow the Lessee to remove the violation by any alternative means approved by the Chairman of the Disputes Committee, if possible, or refer the matter to the Disputes Committee to issue an urgent decision including the following:\n(a) Imposing a fine on the Lessor of not less than five thousand (5,000) Dirhams and not exceeding twenty thousand (20,000) Dirhams, as the Disputes Committee may deem appropriate.\n(b) Compelling the Lessor to compensate the Lessee for all damage sustained due to the violation, or refunding any amounts incurred by the Lessee to remove the violation, if any, and failing that, deducting any amounts decided by the Disputes Committee from the Rent Amount due to the Lessor for the Leased Property, as the Disputes Committee may deem appropriate.\n\n7(5) If the Leased Property is destroyed during the lease term, whether totally or partially, the Lessee may terminate the Lease Contract. The Lessee may not request compensation if the destruction is due to a cause beyond the Lessor's control, such as cases of force majeure like wars, earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters.\n\n7(6) If a material defect appears in the Leased Property that prevents the Lessee from utilizing it fully, and such defect was not known to the Lessee at the time of concluding the Lease Contract, the Lessee may request the Disputes Committee to reduce the Rent Amount reasonably. In the event the Lessee actually incurs any loss or damage as a result of such defect, the Disputes Committee may, upon the Lessee's request, judge in his favor for reasonable compensation as the Disputes Committee may deem appropriate in the concerned circumstances."

If he fails to do so, the Lessee may request the Disputes Committee to issue a decision compelling the Lessor to repair the concerned defect. If the defect relates to the structure of the building or the roof, or if its repair is urgent and cannot be delayed, the Lessee may submit an urgent request to the Chairman of the Disputes Committee to compel the Lessor to repair the concerned defect. The Chairman of the Disputes Committee must treat the request as an urgent order and decide on it, on behalf of the Disputes Committee, in the shortest possible time, and ensure regarding it either obtaining a written undertaking from the Lessor to repair the concerned defect within a period specified in the said undertaking, or failing that, presenting the matter to the Disputes Committee as an urgent matter to issue a decision by the Committee giving permission to the Lessee to repair the defect through a third party determined by the Disputes Committee, with recourse against the Lessor for all that the Lessee spent in repairing the concerned defect, or deducting the value of said repairs from the current or future rent of the concerned property, or extending the lease term by the value of the concerned repairs, or reducing the Rent Amount for the duration of the decrease or loss of benefit that the Lessee was forced to endure, all as the Disputes Committee deems appropriate.\n\n8(3) The Lessee may not prevent the Lessor from performing necessary works for the maintenance of the Leased Property whenever the Lessor wishes to do so, provided that the performance of such works does not lead to preventing the Lessee from utilizing the Leased Property reasonably. If the performance of maintenance results in preventing the Lessee from utilizing the property, the Lessee may request the Disputes Committee to judge in his favor for compensation equal to the damage incurred and the loss of his utilization of the Leased Property during the period of its maintenance by the Lessor."

The Lessee guarantees any shortage, damage, or loss to the Leased Property resulting from his negligence or transgression, unless it is proven by reasonable evidence that such shortage, damage, or loss arose from a cause beyond the Lessee's control. If the Lessee creates any planting, fixed decoration works, or other improvements in the Leased Property, he is committed to leaving them without compensation upon the end of the lease term unless the Lessor agrees otherwise.\n\n9(2) The Lessee must return the Leased Property to the Lessor in the condition it was in at the beginning of the Lease Contract term, except for damage resulting from familiar use or reasonable use of the Leased Property or damage arising from a cause beyond the Lessee's control. If the Lessee received the Leased Property without a statement of its condition, it is presumed that the Lessee received it in good condition unless evidence is established to the contrary.\n\n9(3) The Lessee may not perform any act leading to the vandalism of the Leased Property, damaging it, or decreasing its value. If the Lessee does so, the Lessor may, at any time, request the Disputes Committee to terminate the contract and guarantee the damage he sustained to the extent the Disputes Committee deems appropriate.\n\n9(4) The Lessee may not assign possession of the property, or sublease it, in whole or in part, except with the Lessor's written approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Leased Property is a commercial place or a factory, and necessity requires the Lessee to sell that commercial place or factory accompanied by its material and intangible elements, then the Lease Contract applicable at that time may continue until the expiry of its term without the Lessor's permission, provided that in this case:\n(a) The Lessor is notified of the original Lessee's assignment of the Leased Property, in whole or in part, to the Sub-lessee until the end of the contract term applicable at that time;\n(b) The assignee Lessee provides the Lessor with sufficient guarantee to execute the original Lease Contract with the same terms and conditions; and\n(c) The Lessor does not suffer grave damage as a result of such assignment. The Lessor's loss of the potential increase in the new Rent Amount is not considered grave damage within the meaning intended in this paragraph.\n\n9(5) In the case of subleasing without the Lessor's written permission, the original Lessee remains, in all cases, responsible towards the Lessor for all the Lessee's obligations mentioned in the original Lease Contract. However, the Lessor may collect the Rent Amount directly from the Sub-lessee, and has the right to conclude a new Lease Contract with the Sub-lessee. In the event of concluding such new contract and attesting it properly, the original Lessee is then discharged towards the Lessor regarding all Lessee obligations mentioned in the original Lease Contract.\n\n9(6) Unless there is an explicit provision in the Lease Contract to the contrary, the Lessee is obligated to pay the price of his consumption of water, electricity, gas, sewage fees, telephone, internet network, fees for shared services and the building in which the Leased Property is located, and other benefits related to the use of the Leased Property."

      "title": "Cases in Which Eviction of the Leased Property is Permitted",
      "content": "12(1) The Lessor may not request—even upon expiry of the lease term—the eviction of the Lessee from the Leased Property except for one of the following reasons:\n(a) If the Lessee refuses to sign the new Lease Contract presented to him by the Lessor during the last month from the expiry date of the original Lease Contract or from the expiry date of any extension period thereof, unless the Lessee's refusal is due to an increase in the Rent Amount in a manner contrary to the increase prescribed under the provisions of this Decree.\n(b) If the Lessee fails to pay the Rent Amount, or pay any installment thereof, within a maximum period of two (2) weeks from its due date, without an excuse accepted by the Disputes Committee. However, in the event the Lessor refuses to receive the Rent Amount or the agreed installment thereof in the contract, then the Lessee may deposit the Rent Amount or the concerned installment thereof with the Rapporteur of the Disputes Committee within a time not exceeding three (3) weeks from its due date. Such deposit shall be made without fees or other expenses pursuant to a petition order signed by the head of any chamber of the Disputes Committee. The deposit receipt duly issued by the Rapporteur of the Disputes Committee shall be considered a legal document discharging the Lessee from paying the Rent Amount or the due installment thereof within the limits of the deposited amount. The Rapporteur of the Disputes Committee must hand over the amount deposited with him to the Lessor within a maximum period of two (2) weeks after payment of the prescribed fees.\n(c) If the Lessee fails to perform any obligation imposed on him by this Decree or any condition of the Lease Contract (other than conditions related to payment of the Rent Amount) within a period not exceeding three (3) weeks after the date of his receipt of a written request from the Lessor requesting him to perform that obligation or condition, unless the Lessee's non-performance of the concerned obligation or condition is due to a legitimate excuse approved by the Disputes Committee.\n(d) If the Leased Property sustains grave damage as a result of a deliberate act by the Lessee, or as a result of his negligence in taking necessary caution or care, or due to his enabling any other person to cause damage to the Leased Property.\n(e) If the Lessee leaves the Leased Property vacant for a continuous period of four (4) months and such leaving results in tangible damage to the Leased Property, the Disputes Committee may order the Lessee to vacate even if it is proven that he previously paid the Rent Amount due for the said four (4) months period.\n(f) If the Lessee uses the Leased Property, or allows others to use it, for purposes contrary to the law or incompatible with public morals or the traditions and customs observed by residents in the area where the Leased Property is located, or in a manner that actually harms the Lessor's financial interests.\n(g) If the Lessor presents evidence to the Disputes Committee that convinces the Disputes Committee of the Lessor's need to use the Leased Property for himself or for any of his family members of the first and second degrees (parents, spouse, children, siblings, paternal uncles, maternal uncles). For the lawsuit to be accepted in this case, it is required that the Lessor notifies the Lessee in writing of his need to use the Leased Property at least three months prior to the date of filing the lawsuit.\n(h) If it is proven that the Lessee subleased the Leased Property or part thereof or assigned its possession to a third party without the owner's permission and in violation of the provisions of the Lease Contract and the provisions of this Decree. In this case, the Disputes Committee may also judge to evict the Sub-lessee while preserving his right to claim compensation from the original Lessee.\n(i) If the Lessor desires to demolish the Leased Property because it is dilapidated, or because it has exceeded its operational lifespan, or to perform substantial and complete maintenance of the Leased Property to improve its value or to change the purpose of its use in a way that materially affects its previous status. For a judgment to evict the Leased Property in this case, it is required:\n(1) That the Lessor presents to the Disputes Committee an official certificate issued by the Municipality confirming that the demolition or the concerned maintenance, improvement, and change works are necessary for the Leased Property or that it is consistent with the real estate development plan in the area where the Leased Property is located; and\n(2) That the Lessor obtains the preliminary permission or necessary license from the Municipality to perform the demolition or the required maintenance, improvement, or change works; and\n(3) That the Lessor requests the Lessee to vacate the Leased Property by a written notice duly delivered to the Lessee three (3) months prior to the date of issuance of the preliminary permission or license from the Municipality to perform the demolition or the required maintenance, improvement, or change works.\n(4) That the Lessor executes a written undertaking committing to the provisions of Article (13) of this Decree.\n(j) If a government entity decides that public interest requires the eviction of a property owned by it or under its disposal from its Lessee, and such government entity sends a written notice to the Lessee for a period of not less than three months prior to the date scheduled for eviction, including the justifications and reasons for the eviction decision based on public interest requirements. In this case, the Disputes Committee may, upon the Lessee's request, reject the decision of the concerned government entity due to the absence of public interest or, otherwise, grant the Lessee a grace period and order his continuation in possession of the Leased Property for a maximum period of six (6) months from the date of the Disputes Committee's decision. It may also judge compensation for the Lessee to redress any actual damage sustained by him as a direct result of his eviction under the provisions of this Article, as the Disputes Committee may deem appropriate and fair.\n\n12(2) A Lessee of a commercial, industrial, or professional property may request the Disputes Committee to terminate the Lease Contract after concluding it with him due to the refusal of the competent licensing authorities to grant him the required license to practice the activity required to be practiced in the Leased Property. In this case, the Disputes Committee may judge to terminate the contract provided the Lessee is obligated to pay compensation to the Lessor equivalent to the Rent Amount prescribed for three months.\n\n12(3) A Lessee of a property leased for residential purposes may request the Lessor to terminate the Lease Contract during its valid term for any reasonable reason or justification, by means of a written notice to the Lessor the duration of which is not less than one month. In this case, the Disputes Committee must terminate the contract while obligating the Lessee to pay compensation to the Lessor equivalent to the Rent Amount prescribed for two months, or equivalent to the Rent Amount prescribed for three months in the event of the Lessee's failure to send the aforementioned written notice to the Lessor."

If the Lessor fails to execute such undertaking for any reason whatsoever, or if it is subsequently proven that the Lessor's request to evict the property pursuant to Article (12(g) or 12(i)) was in bad faith or based on incorrect data, then the Disputes Committee may, upon a subsequent request from the Lessee, order the return of the Lessee to the property he vacated and/or obligate the Lessor to compensate the Lessee for any loss and damage he sustained as a result of the eviction. It is required for granting the Lessee's request to return him to the Leased Property or for compensation that he has committed to executing the eviction judgment pursuant to Article (12(i)) within two months from the date of its issuance."

The advertisement shall be published in Arabic in one of the local newspapers at the Lessor's expense, and a copy of the advertisement shall be posted on the door of the Leased Property or in a prominent place thereon.\n\n14(2) If the Lessee appears on the date specified in the advertisement or during the advertisement period and claims the Lessor has no right to evict him from the Leased Property, the Disputes Committee must consider the dispute for eviction of the Leased Property according to the provisions of Article (12) of this Decree.\n\n14(3) If the period granted to the Lessee in the advertisement expires and the Lessee does not appear, the Disputes Committee may form a temporary committee constituted, in each case separately, of a representative of the Municipality, a representative of the Police, and a representative of the Lessor, and authorize the said temporary committee to open the Leased Property in the absence of the Lessee, inventory any valuable properties found inside it, and hand over those properties—if any—to the Lessor to keep as a trust with him or with any other entity the Disputes Committee deems appropriate. Then the property shall be handed over to the Lessor and a detailed report thereof shall be organized and signed by the three members of the temporary committee.\n\n14(4) As an exception to the general rules regarding the execution of judgments in civil lawsuits, the Execution Judge may, on his own motion or pursuant to a request from the Lessor, order the sale of any rapidly perishable properties found inside the Leased Property, or the sale of valuable properties referred to in Clause (14(3)) above, and allocate the proceeds from the sale to pay the outstanding Rent Amount, if any, and to pay any other expenses as he may deem appropriate, and keep the remainder of the sale proceeds—if any—with the Rapporteur of the Disputes Committee for a maximum period of forty-five (45) days, after which such proceeds shall be allocated for any purpose the Execution Judge deems appropriate.\n\n14(5) The handover of the property to the Lessor in the manner mentioned in Paragraph 14(3) above does not affect the Lessee's right to subsequently request the Disputes Committee to obligate the Lessor to compensate the Lessee for damages actually incurred if it is subsequently proven that the Lessor's action was in bad faith or that the data upon which the Lessor relied in his request to the Disputes Committee to open the Leased Property in the Lessee's absence and regain possession for the Lessor, or upon which he relied in his request to sell the properties found in the Leased Property, were incorrect and in bad faith."
